# Music Releases  ðŸŽ¸

This was a pair programming project together with Claire Caudwell. 

The aim of this project was to work in a pair to create a music release page in React using components based on the object information from the Spotify API. We had to follow a specific design template and make the page responsive for mobile, tablet and desktop.

# Tools we used ðŸ› 
1. HTML, CSS and React.
2. NPM to allow us to access and install the react library we needed.
3. Used the Spotify object, that was collected from the Spotify API, and stored in the data.json.
4. Google.
5. Bounced ideas off on another.
6. Asking others for advice.

## View it live ðŸ‘€
